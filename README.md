# Deepak Kumar — Personal Website

This folder contains a simple, static personal website generated from `Deepak_CV.tex`.

## Structure

- `index.html` — main page with sections for About, Education, Research, Publications, Teaching, Skills, and Awards.
- `style.css` — styling for the website.

## How to open the website in VS Code

1. **Open the folder in VS Code**
   - In VS Code, go to `File` → `Open Folder...`.
   - Select `c:\Users\ad2022CHZ8174\Downloads\overleaf_projects\postdoc_applications\my_website`.

2. **Open the HTML file**
   - In the Explorer sidebar, click on `index.html` to open it.

3. **Use "Open with Live Server" (recommended)**
   - Install the VS Code extension **"Live Server"** (by Ritwick Dey) if you don't already have it.
   - Right-click inside `index.html` and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.
   - Your default browser will open the site (something like `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`).
   - Any changes you save in `index.html` or `style.css` will automatically refresh in the browser.

4. **Or open directly in the browser (without Live Server)**
   - In the Explorer, right-click `index.html` and choose **"Reveal in File Explorer"**.
   - Double-click `index.html` in File Explorer to open it in your default browser.

The site is fully static and does not require any build step, server, or additional dependencies.
